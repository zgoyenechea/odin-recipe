    </h3>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4> Meat sauce</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>½ cup yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>6 ounces Italian sausage, fresh, casing removed,
        mild or spicy</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>6 ounces tomato paste</li>
    <li>56 ounces crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Lasagna</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>4 quarts water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, for pasta water</li>
    <li>1 pound lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, lightly whisked</li>
    <li>32 ounces whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>½ cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, freshly shredded</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong> - Set the oven rack to the middle position. 
            Preheat the oven to 375°F (190ºC).</li>

        <li><strong>Saute the Aromatics</strong> - In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium-low heat and sauté onion and 
        garlic until onions are translucent about 3 minutes.</li>

        <li><strong>Brown the Meat </strong> - Turn the heat to medium-high, and add beef and sausage to the pan. Break the
             meat into smaller pieces and cook until no traces of pink remain, about 5 minutes. Season with 1 ½ teaspoon salt 
             and ½ teaspoon black pepper.</li>

        <li><strong>Simmer the Sauce </strong> - Add tomato paste and stir until combined. Cook for 1 minute. Stir in crushed 
            tomatoes and simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Taste and season with more salt and 
            pepper as desired.</li>

        <li><strong>Boil the Pasta </strong> - Bring water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Cook the lasagna according to package directions, 
            occasionally stirring to prevent sticking, until al dente, about 8 minutes. Carefully remove the pasta and transfer it to a sheet 
            pan lined with clean kitchen towels. Place them in a single layer to keep them from sticking together. Set aside until ready to use.</li>

        <li><strong>Make the Cheese Mixture </strong> - In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together eggs, ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, ½ teaspoon salt,
             ¼ teaspoon pepper, and chopped parsley.</li>

        <li><strong>Prep the Baking Dish </strong> - Reserve about 1 cup of sauce and 1 cup of grated mozzarella cheese for topping the lasagna. Lightly 
            coat a 13-inch by 9-inch baking dish with oil. Add enough sauce to lightly cover the bottom of the dish to prevent sticking.</li>

        <li><strong>Layer the Lasagna </strong> - Layer 3 to 4 sheets of lasagna, top with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture, ⅓ meat sauce, and ⅓ of the 
            mozzarella cheese. Repeat for 2 more layers. On the top layer, pour the reserved sauce and cover evenly with the reserved mozzarella cheese.</li>

        <li><strong>Bake the Casserole </strong> - Line a sheet tray with foil and place the baking dish on top. Loosely cover the dish with foil, making sure
             not to touch the cheese. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil. Continue baking until the cheese is hot and bubbly, about 15 minutes. The lasagna 
             can be broiled for a few minutes for an extra browned crust.</li>

        <li><strong>Let it Cool</strong> - Before slicing and serving, allow the lasagna to rest for 15 minutes.</li>
