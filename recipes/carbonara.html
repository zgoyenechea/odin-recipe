    </h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
    <li>6 ounces pancetta, diced</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground</li>
    <li>1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Cook the Pasta</strong> - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and 
        drain the rest.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Pancetta</strong> - In a large skillet over medium heat, cook pancetta until browned and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Whisk the Eggs</strong> - In a bowl, whisk eggs, parmesan cheese, garlic, and black pepper until well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine and Toss</strong> - Add drained spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and toss to combine. Remove from heat and let cool for a minute or two. 
        Add the egg mixture to the skillet, stirring quickly to combine. If the pasta seems dry, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve</strong> - Top with chopped parsley and additional parmesan cheese. Serve hot.</li>
</ol>
